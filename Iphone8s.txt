Apple iPhone 8 Plus Summary
The iPhone 8 Plus is a larger version of the iPhone 8, with a larger screen and battery, more RAM, and a secondary telephoto camera on the rear. It's powered by the same A11 Bionic processor as the iPhone X, which has been shown to be exceptionally powerful, especially in tests that can utilise all six cores at the same time. The display now supports True Tone which adjusts its colour temperature to match ambient lighting. You get 64GB of storage on the base variant but can choose a 256GB option which costs more. Your only choices of colours this time around are Space Grey, Silver, and Gold. The iPhone 8 models also feature new glass backs to support wireless charging, while maintaining the IP67 rating for water and dust resistance. Fast wired charging is supported but you only get a basic charger in the box. You can get through a full day of use with a little power to spare thanks to the large battery.
